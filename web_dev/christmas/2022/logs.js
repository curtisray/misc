***********

Much unlike it's predecessor, this website was actually started with plenty of time before the deadline. I am in my room working, it is christmas day, and I turn 16 in a week. I currently know very little of HTML and CSS and I am struggling to 'get the ball roling' so to speak. Yesterday was christmas eve, and I showed my family the product I had designed. They were pleased. Since I have time, I have decided to start on the second edition immediately.

I haven't worked on this website in a year!!! In just one month, it feels as if I have doubled, tripled, even quadrupled my knowledge and experience in web development. I have decided to scrap what I currently have for this year's website and start again. I am sitting at the table upstairs, waiting for my pasta to finish cooking (mac and cheese). My mom is on the couch laughing at some british show. 

Progress: 

As mentioned before, I have progressed SOO MUCH from the 25. I can make basic html and css pages with buttons and imput. I can embed images and links. I can style text and dividers and backgrounds. I just recently finished my 'Future Options' website that I decided to make for a chemistry assingment. 

Goals: 

    - create/style SVG
    - create login/be able to store user data
    - learn about backend coding
    - create a bot
