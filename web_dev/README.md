# Beginner-Web-Dev
Collection of Beginner Websites consisting of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

### Christmas
A website that is updated periodically every year, to achieve a final result by Christmas Eve. 

The project began 2021 as a last ditch effor to provide a christmas present to the family, but it has since grown into a long lasting project.

### List

My first ever website,

uses various basic html elements such as input, to take an input and return it as a list item. The items on the list can also be deleted.

### Math

Evolution of the *Math Ladder* website. A website designed to house various calculators, untouched by school restrictions.

### School 

(*may become its own repo*)

Collection of Web Development projects related to school. These do not (yet) include any computer science classes or classes that actually require the use of web development skills, but rather, classes that allow openness in choice of projects.
