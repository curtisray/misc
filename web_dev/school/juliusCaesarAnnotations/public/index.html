        <p class="head">Brutus' Speech</p>
        <p class="body">
            Be patient till the last.
            Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my
            cause, and be silent, that you may hear: <b> believe me
            for mine honour,</b> and have respect to mine honour, that
            you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
            awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
            <b> If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
            Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
            was no less than his. </b> If then that friend demand
            why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
            Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
            Rome more. <b> Had you rather Caesar were living and
            <u> die all slaves,</u> than that Caesar were dead, <u>to live
            all free men?</u> </b> As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
            as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
            valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
            slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
            fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
            ambition.
            Who is here <u>so base that would be a
            bondman?</u> If any, speak; for him have I offended.
            Who is here <u> so rude that would not be a Roman? </u> If
            any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here <u>so
            vile that will not love his country?</u> If any, speak;
            for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

        <p class="body">
            <p class="body">Brutus' speech on Caesar's murder contains many rhetorical devices. First, in <b>Bold</b>, we have the three rhetorical devices ethos, pathos, and logos. Beginning with the first, Brutus’s line, “Believe me for my honor” is an example of ethos because he is implying that honor is something that validates one's words and those who do not believe him are morally wrong.</p>
            <p class="body">Second, there is the quote, “If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.” This is an example of pathos because Brutus calls upon friends of Caesar and pulls on their heartstrings by asking them to believe in him out of respect for the man they all loved (Caesar).</p>
            <p class="body">Third, Brutus uses logic to reason for the murder of Caesar, claiming: “Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all free men?” Here he uses logos by reasoning that if Caesar were alive, the quality of life would be significantly worse, and that Caesar’s death has freed the people from potential enslavement.</p>
            <p class="body">In addition to the three rhetorical devices, ethos, pathos, and logos, Brutus also uses figurative language which is shown with an <u>underline</u>. The first display of figurative language is a hyperbole with “die all slaves”, and “live all free men”.  These two claims are exaggerations because Brutus claims that the death of Caesar has benefitted all people by freeing them from their slavery.</p>
            <p class="body">The hyperbole can be seen again in Brutus’ last three claims, “so base that would be a bondman?”, “so rude that would not be a Roman?”, and “so vile that will not love his country?”. Brutus claims that those who thought that Caesar was fit to rule did not love their country and were not truly Roman. It can also be argued that these three claims are also an example of ethos as Brutus attacks one’s morals and ideals. 
            </p>
            <p class="body">Finally, the background image. The background image shows the scene of Brutus’ speech. He can be seen storming away from an erratic crowd holding his script in his hand. It is a correlation to the manner in which Brutus gave his speech, angry and in great haste. The downfall of our once hero is imminent in the face of the raging crowd of Rome.</p>
