                <p class="body">Indonesia was first colonized by the Dutch in the 18th century and traded with Britain up until 1945. Reasons for colonization included a desire for control of the spice trade which Indonesia had great influence over.
                </p>
                <p class="body">However, amidst the chaos of WW2, Japan seized control over Indonesia. As Japan lost its grip on the war, its control over Indonesia suffered. From there, the Japanese began to transfer power from Japan to local leaders to conserve resources. In 1945, Japan surrendered and Indonesia was pronounced independent. </p>

                <p class="body">Before the arrival of foreign powers. Indonesia consisted of small fishing/farming villages. Advancements in technology were rare, and people worked to sustain themselves and their community.
                </p><p class="body">
                    Upon the arrival of the Dutch East India Company, there was immediate retaliation from locals. Citizens fought for rights and independence. The Dutch were never able to gain full control over the archipelago. Where the Dutch were in control, however, farmers were required to devote 1/5 of their land to farming cash crops for the Dutch.
                </p><p class="body">
                    In 1941, amidst WW2, the Japanese Imperial Army began its conquest of southeast Asia including Indonesia.

                    Present-day Indonesia is a democracy governed by Joko Widodo. Presidents can serve a maximum of two five-year terms. Indonesia is undergoing many political reforms to improve bureaucracy and its government is not stable at this time.
                    </p><p class="body">
                    The economy of Indonesia is in the midst of a transition from agriculture to manufacturing. Poverty and underpayment are also a problem in Indonesia. However, as the country transitions away from farming, this is expected to change. As of now, Indonesia is among the top Asian countries to become a world superpower.
