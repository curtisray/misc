                    <p class="body">One option after high school or college could be to get a job at a large tech firm. Working for a large tech company is often seen as the ultimate goal of an aspiring developer. As for myself, I would indeed like to experience such a job, but there are other things I would like to achieve as well. The list above shows the average salary for a junior developer at Google. Senior developers make $188,486 on average but this number can get into the $400k+ range.

                        <li>$103,432</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="body">Another possible place of occupation could be a startup. Startups allow developers to work in smaller teams and have greater freedom with their work. Although they can be risky, many startups offer a great experience and you can make something that you are really passionate about.
