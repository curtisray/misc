                    <ul>
                        <li>6 Months ~ 1 Year</li>

                    <p class="body">Indonesia is a country in Southeast Asia and Melanesia between the Indian and Pacific oceans. It consists of over 17,000 islands and harbors some of the best surf in the world. Interesting spots in Indonesia include Bali and the Mentawais, as well as the island of Java which is home to the second most populated city on earth, Jakarta.

            <div id="southAfrica">
                <div class="textbox"> 
                    <p class="head">South Africa</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>6 Months ~ 1 Year</li>
                        <li>$500 Flight</li>
                        <li>$1309/month</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="body">Another interesting travel option is South Africa. South Africa also offers world class surf but in a much different enviroment. Interesting spots in South Africa include Durban, Capetown, both the Western and Eastern Capes, as well as Jeffery's Bay.</p>

                <div class="textbox">
                    <p class="head">France</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>6 Months ~ 1 Year</li>
                        <li>$350 Flight</li>
                        <li>$933.17/month + Rent</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="body">France would be another travel option, not only in surf but also to pusue my education in French. The French territory I am most interested in is Reunion Island, which is a small island of France that houses a multitude of beautiful breaks as well as a large population of bull sharks.</p>
